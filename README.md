A Vue.js project poc that could serve the youtaite/utaite community! :) (created as final project of Simplon.co)

Issue : Some lack of luck made that when I tried this webapp, I only tested the addition of youtaites (YouTube singers) with YouTube users who had a "username url" along the ID one. I thought the username way was simpler than requiring to get the ID each time so, unfortunately, that created a limitation of who you can add to your database.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8082
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# launch production server
npm start
```
